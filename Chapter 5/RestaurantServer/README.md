# RestaurantServer

The Guided Project of Chapter 5 requires students to use the "RestaurantServer" app. The original app has problems and the workarounds have their own problems for novice programmers (using Python).

This is a recreated version for use with the assignment.

ToDo:
- Option to Edit menu.json
- Better console functionality
- Automatically opening page of server
- Way to change the default port
